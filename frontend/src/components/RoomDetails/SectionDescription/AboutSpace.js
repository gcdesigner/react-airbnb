        This house is very close to downtown Joshua Tree with many shops and
        restaurants about a 10 minute walk from the house. This also means that
        some sound from the highway can be heard. If you're looking for a
        completely silent desert experience, we would recommend our other
        property: The Joshua Tree Casita
        (https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/10614974). Please also check that listing
        if you can't find the dates you're looking for.

        Welcome to the Joshua Tree House! This hacienda was built in 1949. With
        over 100 Joshua Trees on the property, the views from the house are
        magical. If you're up for it, sunrise on the front porch is incredible.
        We estimate that some of the larger Joshua Trees on the property are as
        old as our country!

        *Mattresses and Bedding by Casper* There are two bedrooms and two
        bathrooms in the house, and works well for a group of friends, two
        couples, or small families. We can also set up an extra memory foam
        mattress in the hammock room (has privacy with pocket sliding doors) to
        accommodate groups of six.
